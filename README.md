CeaserToken - Immutable PRC20 with Redistribution and Burn Mechanisms
Introduction
Welcome to the CeaserToken repository! CeaserToken (CSR) is an innovative ERC20 token designed to revolutionize the cryptocurrency landscape with its unique and powerful tokenomics. Inspired by Julius Caesar, the historical figure known for introducing the first tax system, CeaserToken combines modern blockchain technology with timeless economic principles.

Tokenomics
CeaserToken's tokenomics are designed to benefit all holders and create a sustainable, growing ecosystem:

Total Supply: 110,000,000 CSR
Decimals: 9
Fee Structure
Redistribution: 1.69%

Why CeaserToken?
Immutability
CeaserToken is built on the principle of immutability. Upon deployment, the contract ownership is renounced, making the contract immutable and ensuring no further changes can be made. This guarantees a secure, decentralized, and trustless environment for all users.

Passive Income Through Redistribution
With a 1.69% redistribution fee on every transaction, CeaserToken holders continuously earn more tokens, encouraging long-term holding and participation in the ecosystem.

Deflationary Mechanism
A 0.31% burn fee on every transaction ensures a constantly decreasing supply, driving up the value of the remaining tokens and benefiting all holders.

Historical Inspiration
Julius Caesar
Julius Caesar, the famed Roman leader, revolutionized Rome's economy by introducing a tax system that ensured steady revenue for the state. CeaserToken draws inspiration from this historical milestone, creating a sustainable and self-regulating token economy that rewards holders and reduces supply over time.
